þó sjáumk meir um Munin  
But I fear more for Muninn…  

In 2003 I transformed an old static [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20001025140104/http://konrad.lawson.net/) into what was then coming to be known as a blog [using](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202213545/http://muninn.net/blog/index.php) a content management system called [PostNuke](http://www.postnuke.com/) (RIP, 2001-2008). Eventually I moved this to Wordpress [blog](http://muninn.net/blog/), and during my long years as a PhD student from 2004-2012, I posted a variety of thoughts on the site. 

As I sit here in my hometown of Stavanger on midsummer eve, 2015, I thought I might relaunch this blog along with a move again from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), perhaps somewhat ironically, bringing the platform full circle from static HTML, to PHP, and a dozen years later, back to good old HTML (though composed in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)) plain text as part of the trend back to simpler file formats. 

I named the site Muninn, after one of the two ravens Huginn (Hugin) and Muninn (Munin) representing "thought" and "memory" who explored the world on behalf of the norse god Odin. It was a nod to my own terrible forgetfulness, and my desire to record something of my life and thoughts along the way.

The quote from [Grimnismál](http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmnism%C3%A1l)  where we learn a little bit about the two ravens is below:

Huginn og Muninn  
fljúga hverjan dag  
Jörmungrund yfir;  
óumk eg um Hugin  
að hann aftur né komi,  
þó sjáumk meir um Munin.  

Huginn and Muninn  
fly each day  
over the worlds;  
I fear for Hugin,  
that he may not return,  
But I fear more for Munin.
